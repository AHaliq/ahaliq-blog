**WORK IN PROGRESS**
# Constructing Numbers
- kuratowski encoding of tuples
- naturals
- integers
- rational
- reals
- complex

# Ordered Pairs
- relations
- functions 

# Model Theory and Universal Algebra
- signature
- equations

# Order Theory
- poset
- properties
- lattice

# Algebraic Structures
- magma, groupoid, ... cube
- group
- ring
- module
- vector spaces

# Topological Structures
- topology
- metric
- sigma algebra

# Other Explorations
- analysis
- probability & statistics
- algebraic topology
- algebraic geometry
- differential topology; lie algebra

# Conclusion
- tree of construction order
- definitions vs properties (trim down to just pose question)
    - prime numbers; number theory cant be derived from definition
    - geometric meaning of complex numbers cant be derived from definition
    - properties of topological spaces cant be derived from definition
    - relations to other object gives properties
