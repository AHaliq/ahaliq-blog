teaser: Welcome to my blog site where I discuss pure math, logic and programming language theory!

<p>
    I’m a Computer Science graduate from National University of Singapore with a focus area in Programming Languages.
    I’m also a software engineer and researcher with interests in the field of type theory, logic and category theory.

    I got into research intially from my exposure to haskell, and from there I was introduced to alot of pure
    mathematics. Upon coming across homotopy type theory on the internet, I made it a personal goal to understand as
    much as I could about it, which led me to get to know alot of other fields in pure mathematics.

    On the engineering end, I have experience with with formal verification, model checkers and theorem provers, as a
    researcher at SMU’s Centre for Computational Law. I also have experience working with compilers for programming
    languages in CCLAW and in Zilliqa’s smart contract language. And a lil bit of web development as well.
