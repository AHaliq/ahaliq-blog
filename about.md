title: About
---

I’m a Computer Science graduate from National University of Singapore with a focus area in Programming Languages. I’m a software engineer and researcher with interests in the field of type theory, logic and category theory.

I got into research intially from my exposure to haskell, and from there I was introduced to all of the mathematical theory behind the language.

What caught my attention the most at that point in time was homotopy type theory. I then began researching other related fields.

On the engineering end, I familiarized myself with formal verification, model checkers and theorem provers, where I now apply in profession as a researcher at SMU’s Centre for Computational Law.

I have experience working with compilers for programming languages in CCLAW and in Zilliqa’s smart contract language.
