    <div class="content">
        <p>I’m a Computer Science graduate from National University of Singapore with a focus area in Programming Languages. I’m a software engineer and researcher with interests in the field of type theory, logic and category theory.</p>
<p>I got into research intially from my exposure to haskell, and from there I was introduced to all of the mathematical theory behind the language.</p>
<p>What caught my attention the most at that point in time was homotopy type theory. I then began researching other related fields.</p>
<p>On the engineering end, I familiarized myself with formal verification, model checkers and theorem provers, where I now apply in profession as a researcher at SMU’s Centre for Computational Law.</p>
<p>I have experience working with compilers for programming languages in CCLAW and in Zilliqa’s smart contract language.</p>
