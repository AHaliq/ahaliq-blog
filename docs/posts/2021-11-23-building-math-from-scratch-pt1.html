      <div class="content"><p><strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p>Advanced mathematics to me when I encounter them as an undergraduate seemed like an encyclopedia of unrelated facts and formulas and are only motivated by their use in practical applications in solving problems.</p>
<p>Although practical, this view did not explain the common patterns and properties used in many different mathematics and their dependency from one another.</p>
<p>This led me down a rabbit hole of philosophy and foundations of mathematics which I still am exploring today. This series of posts will explore alternative views of organizing mathematics besides by applications.</p>
<h1 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h1>
<p>Instead of starting from mathematics, we begin from a more human and philosophical idea of reasoning. We can define reasoning as a process that helps to discover new truths[1]. It can also be a process to justify our beliefs and verify them. Let us explore some of the main forms of reasoning.</p>
<p>The forms of reasoning we will explore are composed of three elements: rule, cause, effect[2]. The rule is the explaination as to why when a cause happens, the effect follows. Given two of the three components we can derive the third.</p>

</figure>
<p><em>Notice how this definition of the forms of reasoning themselves is a form of reasoning as well? Heres a hint, the intersections are the rule, and the base circles are the cause.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to mathematics, it is a form of deductive reasoning. We start with some assumptions which we call axioms and deduce its consequences.</p>
<h1 id="computation">Computation</h1>
<p>Deductive reasoning can also be seen as a process of verifying the effect given the rules and causes. Thus it can be seen as a decidable problem where given an effect and deductive system, the problem is to answer a yes or no if the effect is derivable from the system.</p>
